Hi, thanks for considering me on this process.

When downloading the project run npm install.

Then, in order to run it you can use: npm run start:dev. The application runs on port 8080.

If you want, you can build a docker image (docker build -t somename .) and run it (docker run -p 8080:8080 somename). Don't forget to map the port 8080.

In order to test the API you can use the file "REST - Transaction.http" (if you have the plugin installed in vscode), postman, or whatever other way you want.

I've not created any method to check if the date is correct due to lack of time. I would have used luxon library in order to do so. D

I haven't create this project from scratch. I've used a template project in order to avoid some hours of configuration and debugging.
I just cleaned most of unnecessary things and adapted it to my porpouse.
I believe all the setup is overkill in order to finish the test, but now you can see a little bit how I've worked before.

I've create a couple of unit test that you can run by using "npm run test".

The tests I've created are from the easiest method. Im aware of that, but again lack of time. I would have to spend a bit more time to create more complex unit tests.

I've not created any integration test. I would have used something like "chai" library, but I dont have much experience with it and it would take me some time to configure it
and to make it run. Im sure I would have it done in a couple (or less) more hours, but I dont really have that time.

I spent almost 4 hours to finish the project. 1 hour aprox to setup, clean, and start a root api from the template project.

Looking forward to hear from you :)
