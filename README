Few things to consider:
I decided to use Singleton pattern to fake a real Database. When restarting the app, data will be lost.

You can start the app on local machine by running "start:dev" or using Dockerfile provided. It will run at port 8080.

You can find an API Example on "REST - Truck.http"

I added tests on the instance of the singleton and Truck class.
